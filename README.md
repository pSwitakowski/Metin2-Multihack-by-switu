# Metin2-Multihack-by-switu
Metin2 Multihack made with Python

Works only on private servers with old python binaries.


1. Put mh and LoaderByKebab.mix in game directory
2. Change LoaderByKebab.mix extension to .dll
3. Inject the loader to metin2 process (using e.g. Extreme Injector) 
4. Load the multihack by: "load mhswitu.py"
5. The Multihack should now be injected and pop up in-game.
